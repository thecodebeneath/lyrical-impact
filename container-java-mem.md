# Docker + Java Memory
Java (JVM) interrogates OS for memory and CPU and is unaware of Docker allocations
* Pre-Java 8.133
* From Java 9 onwards (and from 8u131+ onwards, backported) there are flags added to the JVM:
  * ```-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap```
* Once aware, no need to specify memory to the JVM
  * ``` -Xms1024m -Xmx2048m ```
* Side-note: JVM still is unaware of docker limited CPUs available

# Docker

## Dockerfile

```
EXPORT ...
ENV JAVA_OPTS="--XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal"
ADD ...
```

## Container memory
```
docker run -m 256m -p 8080:8080 acl-msct:latest
```

## Easiest to confirm container memory allocation and usage with:
``` 
> docker stats
CONTAINER ID        NAME                CPU %      MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %      ...
09c4d97970df        romantic_goldwaser   0.13%      125.4MiB / 128MiB   97.96%      ...
```

# Docker Compose

* Memory Limit: A strict upper limit to the amount of memory made available to a container.
* Memory Reservation: This should be set as the bare minimum amount of memory that an application needs to run properly. So it doesnâ€™t crash or misbehave when the system is trying to reclaim some of the memory.

## Version "3", docker-compose.yml
**Note: Does not handle non-swarm mode deployment memory specifications**
```
version: "3"
services:
  lyricimpact:
    build: .
    deploy: <- read as "swarm deployments"
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 256M
        reservations:
          memory: 256M
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

## Version "2.1" docker-compose.yml
Version 2.x does support memory allocations and will for the foreseeable future.
```yml
version: "2.1"
services:
  acl-msct:
    build: .
    mem_limit: 256m
    mem_reservation: 256m
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

# Other commands to inspect container/JVM utilization
```
> docker ps -q | xargs  docker stats --no-stream
> docker top <cid>
> docker exec -it <cid> ps ef
> docker exec -it <cid> top
> docker exec -it <cid> jps | jstat | jmap
```

# Spring Boot Apps
A fairly simple boot app with H2, JPA, actuator, metrics and a few other boot-starters needs "-m 256m"+
How does we estimate/translate our apps to allocate memory to a PCF Java buildpack deployment?
* A typical PCF Tomee buildpack needed 1G+
