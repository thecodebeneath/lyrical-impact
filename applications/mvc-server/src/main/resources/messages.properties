# === about
about.topic.1=What is "Lyrical Impact"?
about.topic.2=What is our Privacy Policy?
about.header=About this site
about.info.1=The Lyrical Impact site is about being moved by artistic language and having a way to remember that feeling.
about.info.2=We believe two significant art forms that use lyrics in impactful ways are songs and poems. Therefore this site allows you \
to capture the most important phrases and verses from these mediums.
about.info.3=This is not a site that will ever have the full poems or the full lyrics to songs; instead it is only for the poignant \
fragments that made people really take notice. Remember that song chorus that you ALWAYS sing along to or the turn of phrase in \
that poem that ALWAYS gives you chills when you read it?
about.info.4=THAT is what we are all about.
 
about.privacy.header=Our Privacy Policy
about.privacy.info.1=Lyrical Impact is public and verses that you add are immediately viewable and searchable by anyone around the world.
about.privacy.info.2=However, your name and other personal information is NEVER made public, even associated with the verses that you add. Additionally, \
your reaction text for your verses is only for your eyes and will not be publicly visible either.
